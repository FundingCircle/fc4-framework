# Get started with FC4

## Installing FC4

Using [Homebrew][homebrew]:

```shell
brew cask install adoptopenjdk11-jre chromium
brew install fundingcircle/floss/fc4
```

For other methods, please see [the full installation instructions][installation].


## Installing Structurizr

FC4 was created at a time when Structurizr Limited hosted a publicly-accessible instance of
Structurizr Express. This is [no longer the case][issue-268].

As of this writing, anyone who wishes to use FC4 must run
[the on-premisis version of Structurizr][s9r-on-prem], which includes Structurizr Express.


## Running Structurizr

Users are referred to [the Structurizr documentation][s9r-on-prem] for instructions on running
Structurizr.

**Please note:** the port specified in the example Docker command in that page is 8080; FC4
therefore uses that port in its default URL for Structurizr Express. If you need to use a different
port, use the FC4 CLI option `--structurizr-express-url` and supply a value other than the
default, which is `http://localhost:8080/express`


## Authoring Diagrams

Abridged workflow:

1. Start Structurizr ([docs][s9r-on-prem])
1. Run in your terminal: `fc4 -fsrw path/to/diagram.yaml/or/dir`
1. Open a YAML file in your text editor and edit it
   1. Either a YAML file specified directly or one in or under a specified directory
1. Whenever you save the file, fc4-tool will see the change, clean up the file (overwriting it) and
   render the diagram to a PNG file (overwriting that file, if it already existed)
1. When youâ€™d like to wrap up your session:
   1. Save the file one last time and wait for fc4-tool to format, snap, and render it
   1. Hit ctrl-c to exit fc4-tool
   1. Run `git status` and you should see that the YAML file has been created/changed and its
      corresponding PNG file has also been created/changed
   1. Commit both files

For the full workflow, please see [The Authoring Workflow][authoring-workflow].
