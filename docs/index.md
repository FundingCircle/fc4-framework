FC4 is a tool for cataloguing, modeling, and documenting software systems.

It facilitates the collaborative and efficient authoring, publishing, and maintainence of:

* a browseable and queryable central catalog/model of software systems
* software architecture diagrams

(TO ADD: an image, something about the components, and a link to the getting started guide (tutorial))

## Background

(REWRITE THE BELOW)

It builds on:

* [the C4 Model][c4-model] and [Structurizr Express][structurizr-express]
  * both of which were created by and are maintained by [Simon Brown][simon-brown]
* [Docs as Code][docs-as-code]
* Docs as Data?

It originated at and is maintained by [Funding Circle](fc-engineering-blog).


## The Name

FC4 is not ([yet][backronym]) an acronym or initialism; it doesn’t stand for anything — it’s “just”
a name.

The name is a combination of “FC” and “C4” — the former is a reference to Funding Circle, the
originating context of the framework; the latter to Simon Brown’s C4 model, the foundation of the
framework.
