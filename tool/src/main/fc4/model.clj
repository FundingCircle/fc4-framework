  "Functions and specs for working with models in memory.
   The representation of a model in memory, as defined by ::model, is an extension of the
   representation of the model in the DSL. For example, while in the DSL a model may not define any
   datasets and would therefore not contain the key :datasets, the model here _must_ contain that
   key, so as to make it easier to work with the data in code."
