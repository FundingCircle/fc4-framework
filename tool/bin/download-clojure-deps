# Clojure automatically downloads deps if necessary
# I don’t know why, but including the :uberjar profile in the below list actually breaks the ability
# to build an uberjar. Something to do with the joda-time or clj-time jar(s) being missing -- I
# guess there’s some kind of conflict between the dependencies of Cambada and one or more of the
# dependencies included in one of the below profiles.
