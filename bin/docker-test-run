# You might think this command should include --rm so as not to litter the
# system with containers, and that’d be reasonable, BUT it can also make
# debugging harder. Sometimes when the packaging scripts fail they write out
# files that are meant to help with debugging; if the container is deleted as
# soon as it exits then those files are gone. So you might want to run `docker
# container prune` every once in awhile ;)

# We’re setting memory and CPU limits here to make the “environment” a little
# more similar to our CI environment than it might otherwise be.
