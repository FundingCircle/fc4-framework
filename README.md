# The FC4 Framework

FC4 is a framework for authoring, publishing, and maintaining software architecture diagrams.

It builds on [the C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr Express](https://structurizr.com/express), both of which were created by and are maintained by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/).

It has two components:

* [the methodology](methodology/README.md)
* the tool: [FC4C](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4c)

It originated at and is maintained by [Funding Circle](https://engineering.fundingcircle.com/).

To get started, we recommend reading [the methodology](methodology/README.md). If you have any questions or feedback please [create an issue](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/issues/new) and one of the maintainers will get back to you shortly.

## The Name

FC4 is not ([yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym)) an acronym or initialism; it doesn’t stand for anything — it’s “just” a name. (This is also true of the name of [FC4C](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4c).)

The name is a combination of “FC” and “C4” — the former is a reference to Funding Circle, the originating context of the framework; the latter to Simon Brown’s C4 model,  the foundation of the framework.

## Contributing

* We cannot currently accept contributions of code or documentation, but we’re working on it.
