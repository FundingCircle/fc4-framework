# This script is for installing system dependencies needed to RUN the tool from a distribution
# package on Debian Linux:
#
# * A Java 8+ JDK (headless should be fine)
# * Chrome or Chromium

# * Nothing to do here, because the Docker image that we’re using for this OS already has OpenJDK
#   and Chrome installed.
# * That said, it can’t hurt to verify that they’re installed.
# * If either command isn’t found, the script will exit, because of the set -e above.

# The Java 8 java command supports -version but not --version (with two dash/hyphen characters)

java -version >> /dev/null
google-chrome --version >> /dev/null
