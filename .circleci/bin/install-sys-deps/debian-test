# This script is for installing system dependencies needed to TEST the tool FROM SOURCE on Debian
# Linux:
#
# * A Java 11+ JDK (headless should be fine)
# * Clojure
# * Chrome or Chromium

# * The Docker image that we’re using for this OS already has OpenJDK 11 and Chrome installed.
# * That said, it can’t hurt to verify that they’re installed.
# * If either command isn’t found, the script will exit, because of the set -e above.

java --version >> /dev/null
google-chrome --version >> /dev/null

# OK, we’re good. Let’s install Clojure:

bin/install-clojure-linux
