# This script is for installing system dependencies needed to TEST the tool FROM SOURCE on Debian
# Linux:
#
# * A Java 11+ JDK (headless should be fine)
# * Clojure
# * ~~Chrome or Chromium~~
#
# NOTE: we used to require that Chrome was installed, but not anymore. That’s because we no longer
# test rendering using the Docker containers that run the scripts in this dir; we switched to
# building our own images. See /test/Dockerfile and /test/docker-compose.yml

# * The Docker image that we’re using for this OS already has OpenJDK 11 installed.
# * That said, it can’t hurt to verify that it’s installed.
# * The script will exit with an error code if the java command isn’t found because of the set -e
#   above.

java --version >> /dev/null

# OK, we’re good. Let’s install Clojure:

bin/install-clojure-linux
